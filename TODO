# TODO

* Make it so it can handle pruned recordings

# Done

* Plot all 6 frequencies (currently only plotting 4)
* Allow me to save my choice of input pathways
* Allow more flexibility in the CSV file format (current CSV files have three columns, TIME, FREQUENCY, ATTENUATION with first row a header).  I’m not asking to include attenuation as a variable… just have the GUI ignore the third column
