# TODO

* Support for larger mesoscope images...?
  Handle the funny strips
* Bug fix! can't find arg?

# Done

x Option to use additional frames for decoder
x Choose output path for images
x Make it so it can handle pruned recordings
x Plot all 6 frequencies (currently only plotting 4)
x Allow me to save my choice of input pathways
x Allow more flexibility in the CSV file format (current CSV files have three columns, TIME, FREQUENCY, ATTENUATION with first row a header).  I’m not asking to include attenuation as a variable… just have the GUI ignore the third column
